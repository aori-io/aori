 * PausedTests - Tests administrative functions for pausing and emergency operations
 *
 * Test cases:
 * 1. testPauseOnlyAdmin - Tests that only the admin can pause the contract
 * 2. testUnpauseOnlyAdmin - Tests that only the admin can unpause the contract
 * 3. testDepositBlockedWhenPaused - Tests that deposit operations are blocked when the contract is paused
 * 4. testFillBlockedWhenPaused - Tests that fill operations are blocked when the contract is paused
 * 5. testWithdrawWorksWhenPaused - Tests that withdrawals fail when the contract is paused
 * 6. testEmergencyWithdraw - Tests the emergency withdrawal of ERC20 tokens by the admin
 * 7. testEmergencyWithdrawETH - Tests the emergency withdrawal of ETH by the admin
 * 8. testEmergencyWithdrawOnlyAdmin - Tests that only the admin can use emergency withdraw functions
 *
 * This test file focuses on the administrative functions of the Aori contract,
 * particularly the pause/unpause mechanisms and emergency fund recovery features.
 * The admin is set to the test contract itself to simplify testing of admin-only functions.
